  The first direct detection of gravitational waves on 14 September 2015 proved
  that massive objects can ripple the structure of space, verifying a key
  prediction of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. The second
  detection, made on 26 December 2015 and announced this June, firmly
  established gravitational waves as a new window to the Universe.
