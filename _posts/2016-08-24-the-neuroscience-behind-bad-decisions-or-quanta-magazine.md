  Humans often make bad decisions. If you like Snickers more than Milky Way, it
  seems obvious which candy bar you'd pick, given a choice of the two.
  Traditional economic models follow this logical intuition, suggesting that
  people assign a value to each choice - say, Snickers: 10, Milky Way: 5 - and
  select the top scorer.
