      As the Pepper robot f rom Softbank scurries about your home or office, it
      reads your emotions by your words, tone of voice, facial expressions, and
      body language. It then responds in all those ways; its hands and posture
      in particular are remarkably expressive.

      Idea in Brief The Threat Automation has traditionally displaced workers,
      forcing them onto higher ground that machines have not yet claimed. Today,
      as artificial intelligence encroaches on knowledge work, it can be hard to
      see how humans will remain employed in large numbers.

  At the heart of this spellbinding book is a simple but chilling idea: human
  nature will be transformed in the 21st century because intelligence is
  uncoupling from consciousness. We are not going to build machines any time
  soon that have feelings like we have feelings: that's consciousness.
