            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The internet as an engine of liberation is an innocent fraud - Nicholas Carr | Aeon Essays</h1><p>It was a scene out of an Ambien nightmare: a jackal with the face of Mark Zuckerberg stood over a freshly killed zebra, gnawing at the animal's innards. But I was not asleep. The vision arrived midday, triggered by the Facebook founder's announcement - in spring 2011 - that 'The only meat I'm eating is from animals I've killed myself.'</p><img src="https://alpha.aeon.co/images/509c2e28-27c2-44e2-b423-ac5740e55e7a/header_essay-fb-world-rtx27y1e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Would you take LSD to give you a boost at work? WIRED takes a trip inside the world of microdosing</h1><p>It's 7am on a sunny Friday in a shared house in the sleepy San Francisco neighbourhood of Richmond. Flatmates buzz in and out of the kitchen as Lily (not her real name), a publicist for several startups, sits down with cup of tea and a credit-card-sized bag of dried magic mushrooms. The 28-year-old breaks up the caps and stems and places them into a herb grinder.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e3b51e212b1f311168815c400ddaf7e1/noop?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwi-images.condecdn.net%2Fimage%2Fpzdr7X5PJPE%2Fcrop%2F1020"></article>]]></description>

Researchers have found evidence that the pollution engulfing China's cities enhances the warming effect of cityscapes, raising the temperature by one degree Celsius. Writing in Nature Communications, they say it's not the bigger cities that suffer the most, but...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/89b5041226448c3659a5310766ce4d57/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fqzprod.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fshanghai-air-pollution.jpg"></article>]]></description>
