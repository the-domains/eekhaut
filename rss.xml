            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will This "Neural Lace" Brain Implant Help Us Compete with AI? - Facts So Romantic - Nautilus</h1><p>Solar-powered self-driving cars, reusable space ships, Hyperloop transportation, a mission to colonize Mars: Elon Musk is hell-bent on turning these once-far-fetched fantasies into reality.

But I was not asleep. The vision arrived midday, triggered by the Facebook founder's announcement - in spring 2011 - that 'The only meat I'm eating is from animals I've killed myself.'</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/664b136bfc04083caa79f7c8d8a799b6/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Falpha.aeon.co%2Fimages%2F509c2e28-27c2-44e2-b423-ac5740e55e7a%2Fheader_essay-fb-world-rtx27y1e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

WIRED takes a trip inside the world of microdosing</h1><p>It's 7am on a sunny Friday in a shared house in the sleepy San Francisco neighbourhood of Richmond. Flatmates buzz in and out of the kitchen as Lily (not her real name), a publicist for several startups, sits down with cup of tea and a credit-card-sized bag of dried magic mushrooms. The 28-year-old breaks up the caps and stems and places them into a herb grinder.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e3b51e212b1f311168815c400ddaf7e1/noop?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwi-images.condecdn.net%2Fimage%2Fpzdr7X5PJPE%2Fcrop%2F1020"></article>]]></description>
